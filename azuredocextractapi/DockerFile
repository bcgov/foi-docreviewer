# Step 1: Use the official Golang image as the builder
FROM golang:1.22 as builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go mod and sum files for dependency management
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source code into the container
COPY . .

# Build the Go application
RUN go build -o main .

# Step 2: Use a minimal image for the final container
FROM alpine:latest

# Set up working directory
WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the compiled binary from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Expose the port your API will run on (default 8080 in most examples)
